# note-link-janitor


Modified version of an original script by Andy Matuschak and PiotrSss that update backlinks in a Zettelkasten folder.

This version of the scripts create specific links adapted to Typora: [[note_title]](note_title.md) but does not include any "context" around the link.

To run the script, you need to install yarn on your computer and follow the instructions described here : https://github.com/PiotrSss/note-link-janitor.
